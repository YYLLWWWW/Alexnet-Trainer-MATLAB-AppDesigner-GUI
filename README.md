# Alexnet-Trainer-MATLAB-AppDesigner-GUI
GUI for create and train Alexnet Neural Network dataset with MATLAB

## Description
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The network is 8 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 227-by-227. For more pretrained networks in MATLABÂ®, see [Pretrained Deep Neural Networks](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/pretrained-convolutional-neural-networks.html).
